cootycather.py simulates an origami fortune teller.  

It offers users the option to customize a fortune teller object within the program - including custom colors and fortunes.  Once the fortune teller object is created the user clicks for on the color, then the numbers they want to select.  The graphics redraw with each selection, simulating the folding and unfolding of the fortune teller.  Once the user has made their final number selection, the fortune teller prints their fortune on the screen.

The program uses the graphics.py library to render an image on the screen.
